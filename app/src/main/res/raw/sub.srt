00:00.110 --> 00:01.350
[-] Good morning,

00:01.350 --> 00:04.530
and welcome to this short breathing exercise.

00:04.530 --> 00:06.400
It's the start of your day,

00:06.400 --> 00:08.850
and before you get pulled into meetings,

00:08.850 --> 00:09.770
your to-do list,

00:09.770 --> 00:14.770
and a multitude of requests from coworkers or family,

00:14.840 --> 00:18.280
let's just take a few minutes to pause together

00:18.280 --> 00:22.490
to come into the present moment and to ground ourselves.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.400
I know it can be hard finding time

00:24.400 --> 00:26.970
in an already packed schedule,

00:26.970 --> 00:30.350
but my hope is that exercises like this one

00:30.350 --> 00:32.740
will actually become part of your day,

00:32.740 --> 00:36.060
instead of something extra you have to fit in.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.410
I would even recommend blocking this time in your calendar

00:39.410 --> 00:41.470
to help you start your workday

00:41.470 --> 00:44.023
with a feeling of calm and clarity.

00:45.530 --> 00:49.363
So take a moment to get comfortable wherever you're sitting.

00:52.210 --> 00:55.743
Nice, upright back with relaxed shoulders.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.743
Make sure both feet are flat on the floor,

01:04.600 --> 01:06.943
and you can just place your hands in your lap,

01:10.020 --> 01:14.343
eyes open with a nice soft, downward gaze.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.170
And just noticing the sensation

01:20.170 --> 01:22.833
of your body pressing down in the seat.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.680
Feeling your feet on the floor

01:27.720 --> 01:29.553
and your hands in your lap.

01:33.990 --> 01:37.893
Notice if your shoulders are tense.

01:39.290 --> 01:42.513
Can you, perhaps, bring them down away from your ears?

01:46.370 --> 01:48.750
We're just using this moment

01:48.750 --> 01:53.260
to come out of the mind and into the body,

01:53.260 --> 01:56.043
fully present in this space.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.430
And you can close your eyes

01:59.430 --> 02:01.543
if you feel comfortable doing so.

02:04.820 --> 02:08.063
We're going to take 10 breaths together.

02:09.090 --> 02:14.090
So first one, start by taking a big, deep breath,

02:14.950 --> 02:16.960
breathing in through your nose

02:19.730 --> 02:21.583
and out through your mouth.

02:23.950 --> 02:27.360
And second, breathing in through your nose

02:30.430 --> 02:32.373
and out through your mouth.

02:35.210 --> 02:38.183
And three, in through your nose

02:41.574 --> 02:43.824
and out through your mouth.

02:45.833 --> 02:46.666
And four.

02:55.354 --> 02:56.187
And five.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.912
And six, in three your nose

03:11.825 --> 03:14.075
and out through your mouth.

03:18.349 --> 03:19.182
And seven.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.683
And eight.

03:37.030 --> 03:38.363
And nine.

03:46.780 --> 03:49.180
And one more deep breath,

03:49.180 --> 03:50.780
in through your nose

03:54.830 --> 03:56.623
and out through your mouth.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.780
And you can allow your breathing just to return to normal,

04:05.780 --> 04:07.663
in and out through the nose.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.990
Open your eyes if you had them closed

04:12.990 --> 04:15.443
and just pausing in this moment,

04:16.390 --> 04:19.330
knowing this time was for you,

04:19.330 --> 04:23.703
fully present and connected ahead of starting your day.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.820
And as you head into your day,

04:26.820 --> 04:30.153
just setting that intention to take this feeling with you.
